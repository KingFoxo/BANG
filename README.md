# BANG

Game Code Name BANG!!!


We start with 6-20 people in a circle one person will be in the middle and call a name of one of the people from the circle. Whoever's name was called will duck (by pressing a randomly generated button on his screen) while the people to the right and left of him have to press a button that also randomly spawns on their screens.  If they hit it at the same time the button will come up anywhere on their screen again.  The goal is to be the last man standing 


Extra note 
Misfires if you misfire you automatically DIE :)
